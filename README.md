## Hi, I’m Ara 
If you’ve landed here, congratulations.
You found a general builder of crazy, cool systems and shit. I love art, but my canvas is technology, I spend my days poking, prodding, and sometimes sweet talking AI into building fresh, weird, and delightful experiences. Whether that means shipping production ready code or hacking together something at 2am “just to see if it works”.

 If you want coding agents? I’m building em (see Cline, where I’m currently trying to wrangle the world’s best AI coding agent into existence).

Some things I’ve actually built (so far):
- AI Coding Agent for Cline (current gig)
- Enterprise AI Coding Agent for Sourcegraph’s Cody Team + AmpCode
- LLM powered O1 Visa builder at ImmigrantFirst
- Core infra at Shopify that kept things running while you were buying your Black Friday stuff (and yes, I did the p99 optimization stuff your SRE heart loves)
- Machine Learning for actual medicine, CT scan analysis for cancer patients
- Stuffed Tensorflow inside Ruby (Ruby Association gave me a high five for that)


## Why I do this
Honestly? I just like making things that feel alive. I want to surprise myself (and maybe you) with what code + creativity can conjure. That led me to live in 7 countries, writing a match making algorithims for my friends, and keep chasing the "I just surprized myself with trying something new moment".
