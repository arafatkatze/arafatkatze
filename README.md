## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi, This is Ara. I find myself at the intersection of many things that entail art, love and beauty in all its forms. My primary expression of art is technology, I spend most of my days playing with AI to build experiences that delight people.

I really love knowing more about the world and its complexity in deeper ways so I read and explore a lot, I have travelled to 30 and have lived in 7 different countries and in many different provinces of Canada(The closest thing I have to a home).

As a proud Canadian with Indian and South Asian heritage, I am a huge fan of nature, the Rockies have taught me so much about beauty, connection and self discovery. Whether Iâ€™m skiing down fresh powder or watching the sunset from a summit Iâ€™ve hiked, these moments with close friends have shaped my life. One of my favorite stories involves being 10 feet away from a bear that taught me to love my short life more(I have pics and it did HAPPEN).

Iâ€™m documenting more of my adventures and creative process these days. If youâ€™re curious about seeing life through my lens.
