## Hi, I’m Ara 
If you’ve landed here, congratulations.

You found a builder of beautiful things. I love art, and my canvas is technology, I spend my days poking, prodding, and sometimes enticing AI into building fresh, weird, and delightful experiences. Whether that means shipping production ready code or hacking together something “just to see if it works”.

 If you want coding agents? I’m building em (see Cline, where I’m currently trying to wrangle the world’s best AI coding agent into existence).

Some things I’ve actually built (so far):
- AI Coding Agent for Cline (current gig)
- Enterprise AI Coding Agent for Sourcegraph’s Cody Team + AmpCode
- Core infra at Shopify that kept things running so you can buy your Black Friday stuff
- Machine Learning for actual medicine and CT scan analysis for cancer patients
- Stuffed Tensorflow inside Ruby (Ruby Association gave me a high five for that)


## Why I do this
I just like making things that feel beautiful. I want to surprise myself (and maybe you) with what code + creativity can conjure. While working on AI, I have lived in 7 countries(travelled to many more), wrote a match making algorithims for my friends to set them up for life, and I am in the constant process of finding new beauty in Art in all its forms.
